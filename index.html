          Python is an object-oriented, cross-platform programming language that
          is widely used for web development, scientific computing, and data
          analysis. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and
          versatility.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python comes with a standard library of modules and classes, such as
            math, datetime, and random, that provide commonly used
            functionality. In addition, third-party libraries can be easily
            installed using package managers like pip to extend the language's
            capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the web, Python is often used in server-side scripting to handle
            requests and responses from clients. Frameworks like Flask and
            Django provide tools for building web applications quickly and
            efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            In scientific computing and data analysis, Python is a popular
            choice because of its powerful libraries for numerical computation,
            such as NumPy and SciPy, and visualization, such as Matplotlib and
            Seaborn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whether you're building a web application or analyzing data, Python's
          simplicity and flexibility make it a valuable tool for developers and
          scientists alike.

        <p>
          The "Hello, World!" program is a simple program that outputs the
          message "Hello, World!" to the screen. It is often used as a first
          example when learning a new programming language. Here's how to write
          the "Hello, World!" program in Python:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open PyCharm and create a new Python project.</li>
          <li>
            Create a new Python file by right-clicking on the project in the
            Project pane and selecting "New" > "Python File".
          </li>
          <li>Name the file "hello_world.py".</li>
          <li>In the editor window, type the following code:</li>
          <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
          <li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value. Variables are
          used to store and manipulate data in a program. You can create a
          variable by assigning a value to a name using the = operator. Here's
          an example of how to create a variable in Python:
        </p>
        <code>my_variable = 42</code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've created a variable called `my_variable` and
          assigned it the value `42`. Now we can use this variable throughout
          our program to refer to this value. Variables can store different
          types of data in Python, such as numbers, strings, and lists. Here are
          some examples:
        </p>
        <code>my_integer = 42<br>my_float = 3.14<br>my_string = "Hello, world!"<br>my_list = [1, 2, 3]</code>
        
        <p>
          You can also assign the value of one variable to another variable,
          like this:
        </p>
        <code>x = 10<br>y = x </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've assigned the value `10` to `x`, and then
          updated `x` to have the value `20`. Variables are an important concept
          in programming and are used extensively in Python and other
          programming languages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines the
          possible values that the data can take and the operations that can be
          performed on it. Python has several built-in data types, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integers: whole numbers, such as 1, 2, and 3.</li>
          <li>Floats: decimal numbers, such as 3.14 and 2.0.</li>
          <li>
            Strings: sequences of characters, such as "hello" and "world".
          </li>
          <li>Booleans: values that are either True or False.</li>
          <li>
            Lists: ordered collections of values, which can be of different data
            types.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tuples: ordered collections of values, which are immutable (cannot
            be changed).
          </li>
          <li>Dictionaries: unordered collections of key-value pairs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To determine the data type of a value or variable, you can use the
          type() function. For example:
        </p>
        <code
        my_integer = 42<br>
        print(type(my_integer))  # Output: class 'int'><br><br>
        
        my_string = "hello"<br>
        print(type(my_string))  # Output: class 'str'>
        </code>
        <p>
          You can convert between data types using built-in functions, such as
          int(), float(), and str(). For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >my_string = "42" <br>
          my_integer = int(my_string) <br>
          print(my_integer) # Output: 42
        </code>
        <p>
          Understanding data types is important in programming, as it determines
          the types of operations that can be performed on data and how that
          data can be manipulated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <p>
          In Python, an if...else statement allows you to conditionally execute
          code based on a boolean expression. The general syntax of an if...else
          statement is:
        </p>
        <code
          >if condition:<br>
          # Code to execute if condition is True<br>
          else:<br>
          # Code to execute if condition is False
        </code>
        <p>
          The `condition` in the if statement is a boolean expression that
          evaluates to either True or False. If the condition is True, the code
          inside the if block is executed. If the condition is False, the code
          inside the else block is executed. Here's an example of an if...else
          statement in action:
        </p>
        <code
          >x = 10<br>
          if x > 5:<br>
              print("x is greater than 5")<br>
          else:<br>
              print("x is less than or equal to 5")
        </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we check if `x` is greater than `0` using the `>`
          operator. If it is, we print the message "x is positive". If not, we
          move on to the next condition and check if `x` is equal to `0` using
          the `==` operator. If it is, we print the message "x is zero". If
          neither condition is True, we execute the code inside the else block
          and print the message "x is negative". if...else statements are a
          fundamental building block in programming and are used extensively in
          Python and other programming languages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>
          In Python, loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly,
          either a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is met.
          There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` loops and `while`
          loops. A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list
          or a string) and execute a block of code for each item in the
          sequence. The general syntax of a `for` loop is:
        </p>
        <code
          >for item in sequence:<br>
          # Code to execute for each item in sequence
        </code>
        <p>Here's an example of a for loop that prints each item in a list:</p>
        <code
          >fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
          for fruit in fruits:<br>
             print(fruit)
        </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've defined a list of fruits and then used a `for`
          loop to iterate over each item in the list and print it to the
          console. A `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code
          as long as a certain condition is True. The general syntax of a
          `while` loop is:
        </p>
        <code
          >while condition:<br># Code to execute as long as condition is True
        </code>
        <p>Here's an example of a while loop that counts from 1 to 5:</p>
        <code>count = 1<br>while count <= 5:<br> print(count)<br> count += 1 </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've initialized a variable `count` to `1`. Then
          we've used a `while` loop to repeatedly print the value of `count` to
          the console and increment `count` by `1` until it reaches `5`. Loops
          are a fundamental concept in programming and are used extensively in
          Python and other programming languages to iterate over data
          structures, perform calculations, and perform other tasks that require
          repeated execution of code.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions are a way to group related code together and reuse it
          throughout your program. In Python, you can define a function using
          the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function and any
          parameters it takes, enclosed in parentheses. The body of the function
          is then indented below the function definition. Here's an example of a
          simple function that adds two numbers together and returns the result:
        </p>
        <code>def add_numbers(a, b):<br> return a + b </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've defined a function called `add_numbers` that
          takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. The body of the function simply
          adds these two numbers together and `returns` the result using the
          return keyword. To use the `add_numbers` function, we can call it and
          pass in two numbers as arguments:
        </p>
        <code>result = add_numbers(3, 5)<br> print(result) # Output: 8 </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we're calling the `add_numbers` function and passing
          in the numbers `3` and `5` as arguments. The function returns the
          result of adding these two numbers together, which is then assigned to
          the variable `result` and printed to the console. Functions can also
          have default parameter values and can return multiple values using
          tuples. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <code
          >def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):<br> return greeting, name<br><br> result1 =
          greet("Alice")<br> result2 = greet("Bob", "Hi")<br><br> print(result1) # Output:
          ('Hello', 'Alice')<br> print(result2) # Output: ('Hi', 'Bob')
        </code>
        <p>
          In this example, we've defined a function called `greet` that takes
          two parameters, `name` and `greeting`, with a default value of
          `"Hello"`. The function returns a tuple containing the `greeting` and
          `name`. We then call the `greet` function twice, once with just a name
          and once with both a name and a custom greeting. The function returns
          a tuple in both cases, which we assign to the variables `result1` and
          `result2`. We can then print these tuples to the console. Functions
          are a powerful tool in Python that allow you to write modular,
          reusable code. By defining functions that perform specific tasks, you
          can make your code more organized, easier to read, and more
          maintainable over time.
